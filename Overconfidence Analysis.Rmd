# Preliminary steps
Let's define our local folder as follows:
```{r}
setwd("/home/juan/Documents/GitHub/Overconfidence")
```
and let's load the raw data as follows
```{r}
load("~/Documents/GitHub/Overconfidence/d.RData")
```
Readers interested in reproducing our results might clone the repository or just download the raw data along with its corresponding scripts.

Now, let's run some preliminary ad-hoc functions for reporting results and creating graphs
```{r}
source("helper.R")
source("helper2.R")
source("graphs.R")
```
